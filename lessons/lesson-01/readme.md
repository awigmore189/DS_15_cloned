Also, I highly recommend checking out the following books:
- [Data Science for Business](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028918.do) - It does a great job of describing the role data science plays in different industries.
- [Automate The Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) - **Even though this book uses Python 3**, it does a great job of introducing Python from an applied perspective.
