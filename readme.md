Welcome to DS-DC-15!

In this 10 week part-time course, we will use Python (v2.7) to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, our goals are:
- Learn the language of data scientists to contribute as a part of a greater team.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, python, and the command line.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to a non-technical audience through visual storytelling.

You've all been invited to use Slack for chat during class and the day. Feel free to use it to chat with us or other students about the lessons, labs, or homework. It's a great way to keep in touch and easily share code/content. Our Slack homepage is [https://dsdc15.slack.com/](https://dsdc15.slack.com/).

If you've never used Slack before, [here's a quick primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RJZMSsH7-g).

## Office Hours
Every week, Doug and TBD will hold office hours where you can stop by to talk about anything related to the course. *It's a great opportunity* to discuss topics we've covered in more detail or answer any questions you may have about the lesson/homework/projects.

## Exit Tickets
At the end of each lesson, you'll be asked to fill out an Exit Ticket which is a brief survey on how the class went. Your feedback is **important** and will be incorporated into the class to ensure that everyone is getting the most out of the course.
